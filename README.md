<h1 align="center">openai vision api experiments üß™</h1>

## üëã Hello

The must-have resource for anyone who wants to experiment with and build on the [OpenAI
Vision API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision). This repository serves as
a hub for innovative experiments, showcasing a variety of applications ranging from
simple image classifications to advanced zero-shot learning models. It's a space for
both beginners and experts to explore the capabilities of the Vision API, share their
findings, and collaborate on pushing the boundaries of visual AI.

Experimenting with the OpenAI API requires an API üîë. You can get one
[here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- 100 API requests per single API key per day
- Can't be used for object detection or image segmentation
